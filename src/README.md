# Fine wine classification

This code runs on the server side which is configured as the MQTT broker to receive the messages. It creates a web server which updates a website based on the data which is read from the accelerometer, clearly allowing a coach or other support personnel to identify when a player has suffered a trauma. The script contained within `main.py` handles the creation of the web sever and the MQTT server to listen to incoming messages from all of the connected players.
